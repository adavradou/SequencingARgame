# SequencingARgame
A sequencing game using Augmented Reality for daily activities, such as taking a shower, brushing teeth and going to school.
Instead of cards, the player is using QR-Codes, and using the device camera, the corresponding activity is shown through the screen using the Vuforia engine.
The player must place the cards in the right order, before the time ends, in order to pass to the next level.

An example of is shown below:
